Colour is a bit anaemic, with a rather insipid froth to the head. The typical range of spicy/citrusy flavours with a quite clear, tart finish. Nothing special but certainly pleasurable.

Straw yellow soft gentle pour leads to light carbonation through clear direction. Some citrus flavor. Not bad for an American wheat.  Entertaining but not much benefit.

On tap at Clybourn:  Soft yellow.  Thin, and not remarkable.  Nice citrusy tang.  A little bit of funk? Not as bad as some say.  Weird label.  Thanks to  Ma Beth.
