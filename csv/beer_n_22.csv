Pours a very pale yellow with a large, white head.  Aroma similar to German style beers.  Not bad, not great, somewhat like a mild pilsner.  Slightly bitter aftertaste.

This is the worst beer I’ve ever tasted.  Sour and bitter, with too much carbonation.  My friend described it as ""skunk pee"", and I totally agree.  I would prefer Bud to this, and I hate Bud.
