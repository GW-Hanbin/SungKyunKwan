Piana duża, ale szybko opadła. W zapachu goździk, delikatny banan, i z tego razem wyszła mi guma balonowa ""Donald"". Piwo mętne, bez goryczki, prawie słodkie. Ogólnie polecam.

Not my favorite weiss, but pretty good.  A little darker in color than most and a bit fruity, but not too sweet.  Some citrus flavor, but not overpowering.  A bit better than average.

Archtypical German Hefe.  Great crisp taste, fruity overtones.  Great color and head.  Not a great Hefe fan, but I'd much rather have this that a Bud on a nice hot summer day!

I'm not a huge fan of Wheat beer, but this one is as nice as they get.  Very refreshing.  Makes you feel like you just had breakfast.  I wonder if it's good on cereal?

The archetypal German hefe-weizen for me.  It's really everything a wheat should be.  It's not as exotic or as expensive as some, it makes a great consistent hefe-…

This is the Hefe by which I measure all others. (I have had better, but they are rare, so rare that I can barely remember the names.) Yum.Yum. I love it!

Has a wheaty-yeasty aroma, like a Hefe should.  Body is cloudy (I rolled my bottle prior to opening), somewhat ""thick"" for a beer, but true to style.  Flavor was complex, with hints…
