12oz - Nice palate, color and lacing, a bracing scent of hops on the nose.  The flavor on the first sip seemed a little sweet, but subsequent sips were a solid, fresh, bright IPA.  I liked it.

Damn fine American IPA.  Loaded with hops, this one will not leave you disappointed.  Piney aroma and a grapefruit after taste.  Wonderful out of the bottle.

Smelled great, the hops kicked ass throughout actually.  Not as bitter as the traditional IPA, but it had a great flavor.  We will say, good beer but not overly indicative of the style.

(draft) Golden yellow, beautiful head. Fruity/hoppy nose. Just a sip of the head revealed the hops in this badboy. Medium bodied with tons of malt and even more hops, excellent IPA.
