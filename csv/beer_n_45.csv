It is the perfect beer when its hot and you just need something cold to drink. It is like water, but this time in a good sense. In my opinion, it only lask a little of taste.

Pale yellow with aroma of light corn.  Taste is of corn, with a dry astringent finish.  Kind of thin and watery, but better than an American macro.

Ligt yellow clear colour. Thin lacing head. Nose of sewer and a hint of hops. Very dry and intense iron flavour. Sour with no finish at all. Feels like a battery on the tongue.
