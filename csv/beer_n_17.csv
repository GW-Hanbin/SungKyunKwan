Had a few of these in hong-kong.  Pale colour, light yellow.  Crisp lager but not much substance - no interesting hoppy finish or sweet lager finish.

Smooth, drinkable lager. However, I wouldn't buy it again because it is similar in style and taste to many local lagers but much more expensive.

A superb lager beer with plenty of nose. A thirst quenching bite, best drank when ice cold

This beer is crisp and quenching and it goes down surprisingly easy but the flavour is not very profound (despite a sugary, overforceful aftertaste)

This is by far the best beer around.  I grew up in Singapore and I was raised on Tiger, so that might explain why I like it so much.  Nothing beats a tall cold tiger draft on a hot night…

Straight forward lager.  No hints of anything significant.  I didn't detect any of the fruit hints.

Pale yellow.  Odd esters in the nose - pear, green apple - always a sign of a failed lager.  Light and watery, with some slight fusel influence.  Unclean, hopless, a total drain pour.
