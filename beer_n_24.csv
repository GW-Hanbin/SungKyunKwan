Bland, quite bland. Light on the malt (and probably fermented with a lot of sugars). Light on the hops. Also lacked gassing and head, which was a disappointment.

Mama Cass died choking on a sandwich. Is this named after her? It would be hard to choke on such a thin offering of course, but I am sure it is achievable.
