Beck´s is a real average beer. The taste is not bad, but also not (very) good. If you only drink one or two it´s ok, but if you drink more the taste becomes bad.

REAL skunky.  Among beers popular in North America, only Molson Export is even close to being so skunked.  Beck's is one of the more overrated beers I've ever had.

With all the great German beers in the world, mass-produced and marketed Beck's would have to be one of the worse. Better, of course than the American fare of BudMillerCoors,…

This is decent when not skunked (which is more often than not, it seems).  Definately a step or two above budmilloors crap.  I drink this on occasion.

Beck's is OK. The thing I like about it is that I think it uses higher quality ingredients than some other low-to-mid range beers.

Beck's is a decent german beer.  It's a little light for my tastes and usually if I'm not going for a dark beer I'm going for a hef but this used to be one of my old stand-bys.
