500ml can from Carrefour, Xiamen. Pours clear golden with a dissipating white head. Aroma of malt. Sweetish taste and finish. A step up from the very basic pale lagers.

Smells very sweet creamy and malty. Not bad, light but with an amber ale type maltiness. A tongue covering graininess, creamy texture. Good for such a simple beer.
