Golden color, excellent foam. There is a lot of metal in the aroma, in the malt taste and there is some kind of fruity note. Pilsner is not here, a typical Euro lager.

Has a faint hint of some rotting vegetable in the aroma and the taste isn't much better. Some sips make me flinch and others remind me of nasty beers that I drank in college.

Its not a bad lager, it is safe. Not too strong or too weak. Decent flavor, but not extravagant. I always worry about imports with cliche names, but my fears were subsided.
